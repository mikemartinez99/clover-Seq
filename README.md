## Development To Do
- Within each database directory in GMBSR/genomic_references, run the `make_all_feature_bed.py` code to generate an `allfeats.bed` file. Also include a README in each database that says how this file is ran.
Or, add it as a snakemake rule for the database build snakemake (probably go with this for cleanliness)

```shell
python make_all_feature_bed.py \
    db-maturetRNAs.bed \
    db-trnaloci.bed \
    genes.gtf
```

- Instead of using awk counting of idxstats for `rule tRNA_count`, implement `countreads.py` in a similar fashion to how `rule count_smRNAs` is implemented.

- Improve visualizations for exploratory analysis. 
    - Compare R median of ratios normalization script to miRNA-PCA script

- Add R visualization scripts to their own subfolder in the `code` directory

- **DOUBLE CHECK** that our mapping strategy allows for multi-mapping which is super important because of codon degeneracy.

- Start working on differential expression workflow

- Add database building workflow implementation to README


## Introduction
This pipeline supports the analysis of mature-tRNAs and other small RNAs (smRNAs) for human (hg38), mouse (mm10), and fly(dm6) genomes. While typical RNA-Seq preprocessing strategies are employed in this pipeline, special considerations to handle tRNA biology are included. Custom reference databases encompass the full host genome along with mature tRNA transcripts with the addition of 3' CCA tails not encoded genomically. 

Following preprocessing workflow, differential expression can be performed using the differential expression workflow included in this repo (FUTURE)

## Installation
To install this code, clone the github repository

```shell
git clone https://github.com/mikemartinez99/clover-Seq

```

Several [conda environments](https://anaconda.org/anaconda/conda) are required to run this code successfully and can be built using the associated yaml file in the [env_config folder](https://github.com/mikemartinez99/clover-Seq/tree/main/env_config) using the following command:

```shell
conda env create -f name.yaml
```


## Databases
tRNA-genome references encompass the full host genome with additional tRNA-specific gene information obtained from [gtRNAdb](https://gtrnadb.ucsc.edu) through [tRNA-scan](https://lowelab.ucsc.edu/tRNAscan-SE/) experiments. Encompassed in these databases are bed files of mature tRNA sequences as well as native pre-tRNA loci in the host genome. Stockholm alignment files and alignment-number files help with downstream conversion of tRNA alignments to [Sprinzl-positions](http://polacek.dcbp.unibe.ch/publications/Holmes%20et%20al_tDR%20nomenclature_Nat.Meth_2023.pdf). 

These references are pre-downloaded along with pre-built Bowtie2 indices and hosted on the [Genomics and Molecular Biology Shared Resources](https://geiselmed.dartmouth.edu/gsr/) on Discovery for ease of use and efficiency. However, if you wish to build from scratch, or customize the reference, a workflow for doing so is included. 

For more information on the files included in the database, see [Files](#files)

References can be accessed at the following path on Discovery: 

`/dartfs-hpc/rc/lab/G/GMBSR_bioinfo/genomic_references/tRAX_databases`

## Pipeline Summary
Clover-Seq is adapted from the [tRAX Pipeline](https://github.com/UCSC-LoweLab/tRAX) to be implemented as a Snakemake workflow to allow sample parallelization and efficiency. As input, this pipeline takes raw fastq.gz files, a config.yaml file, and two text files to guide the Snakemake script.

|Snakemake Rule|Purpose|Conda Environent|
|--------------|-------|----------------|
|`trimming`|Trim fastq files to remove adapters and reads not meeting size threshold|`clover-seq`|
|`tRNA_align`|Align sequencing reads to combined tRNA sequences and host genome, perform length and quality filtering|`clover-seq`|
|`tRNA_mark_duplicates`|Flag sequencing duplicates|`rnaseq1`|
|`tRNA_map_stats`|Collate idxstats and flagstats metrics|`clover-seq`|
|`tRNA_count`|Count tRNA isotype reads as well as gene-level tRNAs/smRNAs in the genome|`clover-seq`|
|`read_length_distribution`|Collate read-length statistics for all reads (tRNA + non-tRNA)|`clover-seq`|
|`count_smRNAs`|Collate smRNA biotype counts across groups and samples|`clover-seq`|
|`normalize_and_PCA`|Calculate size factors and normalized-counts for tRNA-isotypes and gene-level counts, run PCA|`clover-seq`|

## Preprocessing Implementation
To run the preprocessing pipeline, modify the `Sample_list_SE.txt` file. This is a comma-delimited three column file (Sample_ID, fastq_1, Group).
Note that modifying header names will cause the pipeline to fail! Simply modify your sample names, path to the raw fastq.gz file, and Group. Below is an example of how this file should look. 

```text
Sample_ID,fastq_1,Group
IB1,data/IB_1_S1_R1_001.fastq.gz,WT
IB2,data/IB_2_S2_R1_001.fastq.gz,WT
IB3,data/IB_3_S3_R1_001.fastq.gz,KO
IB4,data/IB_4_S4_R1_001.fastq.gz,KO

```

The `config.yaml` file provides important file paths that allow the Snakefile to dynamically run. Utilize the config specific to your organism in the [preprocessing prebuilt configs folder](https://github.com/mikemartinez99/clover-Seq/tree/main/preprocessing_prebuilt_configs). A list of case-sensitive parameters as specified in the config are listed below:

|Parameter|Value|
|---------|-----|
|`sample_txt`|Sample_list_SE.txt|
|`layout`|one of `single` or `paired` (currently only supports single)|
|`genome`|one of `hg38`, `mm10`, or `dm6`|
|`refLevel`|A reference level from the group column in Sample_list_SE.txt|
|`trna_db`|Path to publically hosted, pre-built tRNA databases|
|`bt2_index`|Path + bowtie2 index prefix for publically hosted, pre-built tRNA genome Bowtie2 index|
|`adapter_1`|Adapter sequence 1 (Illumina universal)|
|`adapter_2` |Adapter sequence 2 if paired-end (Illumina universal)|
|`maxMaps`|Number of mutli-mappings to accept per read|
|`nPenalty`|Penalty score for ambiguous bases (set to 5 to account for tRNA biology)|


Modify the `job.script.sh` script accordingly to point to your config file using the `--configfile` argument. Below is an example using the hg38 tRNA genome and specifying to submit 10 jobs in parallel across different cluster nodes as specified by `--profile cluster_profile`

```shell
#----- Run snakemake workflow
snakemake -s Snakefile \
    --use-conda \
    --configfile /preprocessing_prebuilt_configs/hg38_config.yaml \
    --conda-frontend conda \
    --conda-prefix /dartfs/rc/nosnapshots/G/GMBSR_refs/envs/DAC-RNAseq-pipeline \
    --profile cluster_profile \
    --rerun-incomplete \
    --keep-going 
```

To submit your job, run the following code. 

```shell
#----- Submit snakemake job script
sbatch job.script.sh
```
To check the status of your Snakemake job and all child jobs it spawns, run the following (replacing NETID with your Dartmouth NetID)

```shell
#----- Check user job status
squeue | grep "NETID"
```

You will notice your directory will populate with logs following the convention: log_X_RuleID_JobID.out. For rules that run on a per-sample basis, there should be one log for each sample. For rules that run once for all samples together, there should be only a single log.
