## Introduction
The pipeline was inspired by the [tRAX pipeline](https://github.com/UCSC-LoweLab/tRAX) but adapted to be compatible with Snakemake and allow parallel processing on the [Dartmouth Discovery HPC](https://rc.dartmouth.edu/discoveryhpc/). This pipeline supports the analysis of tDRs, mature-tRNAs and RNA modification for human (hg38), mouse (mm10), and fly(dm6) genomes. 

## Databases
tRNA-genome references encompass the full host genome with additional tRNA-specific gene information obtained from [gtRNAdb](https://gtrnadb.ucsc.edu) through [tRNA-scan](https://lowelab.ucsc.edu/tRNAscan-SE/) experiments. These references are pre-downloaded along with pre-built Bowtie2 indices and hosted on the [Genomics and Molecular Biology Shared Resources](https://geiselmed.dartmouth.edu/gsr/) on Discovery for ease of use and efficiency. However, if you wish to build from scratch, or customize the reference, a workflow for doing so is included. 

References can be accessed at the following path on Discovery: 

`/dartfs-hpc/rc/lab/G/GMBSR_bioinfo/genomic_references/tRAX_databases`

## Development Notes:
-  Is mapping too stringent (20% of bases are modified in tRNA)
AMino counts not informative
Coverage plots are useful (normalized read count)
Mutations: Linear modeling and bundance (this will always be pairwise) - miRNA-specific data for mining
Estebans data are size selected (tRNA selecting anything under 200 nt in length (snRNAs, snoRNAs, tRNAs, miRNAs, fragments))
CCA, CC, C endpoint tails : shows maturity (pretRNA is usually longer than the mature tRNA)
tRNA modifications heatmap

VOlcano plot for just tRNAs and then a separate one for all other small RNAs
140 - 250 nts returned (120 of those are adapters)
Also might be interested in mapping tRNA fragments

Clean up microbes step....
Might also be working in zebrafish

#----- Jargon...
Isodecoders - isoforms of tRNAs (gtRNAdb) --RSEM????? -> as long as you have a gtf
Isoacceptros - grouping by family (codon rdegeneracy)

Seed length too long
